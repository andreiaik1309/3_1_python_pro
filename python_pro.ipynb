Text: Armed with this information, manufacturers, retailers, and academics have developed\n"," extraordinarily detailed models to measure the effectiveness of promotions and other \n"," marketing tactics like consumer ad- vertising, price changes, and public relations. \n"," A common denominator of all these models is that in order to determine the effectiveness\n","  of a given marketing tactic, one needs to determine first the benchmark baseline sales \n","  level (i.e., the expected sales in the absence of a particular marketing variable like\n","   price promotion). It is worth noting that the baseline sales are simply the \n","   counterfactual of sales activity in the hypothetical case of no promotions for a \n","   period of time.\n","In this paper, we propose a new model to estimate baseline sales and compare it to the \n","two models that are considered to be the industry and academic standard: Scan*Pro \n","(Wittink, Addona, Hawkes & Porter 1988) and PromotionScan (Abraham & Lodish, 1993).\n"," Scan*Pro and PromotionScan were developed in conjunction with ACNielsen and IRI. \n"," Both are log-linear models that provide estimates of baseline sales and sales \n"," response as a function of specific retailer promotional tactics such as price \n"," discounts, feature ads, and displays. According to Bucklin, and Gupta (1999) and\n","  to Hanssens, Parsons, and Schultz (2000), both models are fundamentally similar.\n","While there have been no formal academic challenges to the validity of the model, \n","there are obvious data limitations in terms of quality and availability. \n","The use of disaggregated data could potentially have mea- surement errors.\n"," Moreover, CPG practitioners and consultants generally recognize that the baseline \n"," sales generated by these models are flawed in that they yield “phantom” spikes.2 \n"," They show increases in baseline sales exactly concurrent with promotional activity \n"," when the expectation is that no such spike should occur. In Figure 1, we show \n"," one example of regular phantom spikes. Later in this paper, we explain why \n"," baseline sales are supposed to be relatively stable estimates over time and \n"," why baseline estimates should be uncorrelated with promotional activity.\n","Размер исходного текста в битах:  17320\n","Размер сжатого текста в битах:  9639\n","Коэффициент сжатия:  0.5565242494226328\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["text_to_compress = 'aaaaaaaaaaaffffffpp'\n","compressed_text, huffman_codes = compress(text_to_compress)\n","decompressed_text = decompress(compressed_text, huffman_codes)\n","\n","print(\"Original Text:\", text_to_compress)\n","print(\"Compressed Text:\", compressed_text)\n","print(\"Decompressed Text:\", decompressed_text)\n","\n","# Оценка степени сжатия\n","original_size = len(text_to_compress) * 8\n","compressed_size = len(compressed_text)\n","print('Размер исходного текста в битах: ', original_size)\n","print('Размер сжатого текста в битах: ', compressed_size)\n","compression_ratio = compressed_size / original_size\n","print(\"Коэффициент сжатия: \", compression_ratio)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gpdDQ8sP-2iL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696847823561,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":342,"user":{"displayName":"Andrei Yakovlev","userId":"16152126144074724447"}},"outputId":"cc1605ff-3690-4e1b-f261-f35d544edb34"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Original Text: aaaaaaaaaaaffffffpp\n","Compressed Text: 111111111110101010101010000\n","Decompressed Text: aaaaaaaaaaaffffffpp\n","Размер исходного текста в битах:  152\n","Размер сжатого текста в битах:  27\n","Коэффициент сжатия:  0.17763157894736842\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"eMxLqEvQ-2fQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"98D8c1zD-2YA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
